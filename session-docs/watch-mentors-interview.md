# Async: Watch our mentors interview each other ðŸ˜…

We thought it would be helpful for you to see how a professional web developer answers questions in an interview format, so we role played 2 interviews live for the group. It wasn't stressful at all!

There are 2 common types of interviews that most companies do: job fit and technical. 

> **Job fit interviews** typically attempt to assess whether the person has the general background, skills, and attitude to be successful in the open role. Andrew interviewed Shelley in a mock job fit interview.


> **Technical interviews** are geared towards determining the technical skill level of the applicant. Raj interviewed EJ in a mock technical interview.
