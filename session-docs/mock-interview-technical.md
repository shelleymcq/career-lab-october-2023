# Sync: Technical mock interview

Each Collabie will be paired with a mentor for the technical mock interview.

The interviews will run a maximum of 1 hour, including time for you to ask questions about the role and company as well as time for the mentor to give feedback on the content and style of your responses.

<aside>
üíª <strong>Technical interviews</strong> are designed to assess the level of your technical skills. These interviews can take many formats. Sometimes they are a review of a take-home assignment you‚Äôll have completed ahead of time. Sometimes they might involve ‚Äúwhite-boarding‚Äù a technical solution on the spot. These interviews also typically include more general questions about programming and problem-solving.
